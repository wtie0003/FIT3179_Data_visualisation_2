                CO2 emissions is a critical issue as several nations face the environmental severe impact of industrialization and energy use. 
                This visualization explores global emission trends, focusing on how 
                major countries such as <span style="color:green;"><strong>Australia</strong></span>, <strong>China</strong>, 
                and the <strong>USA</strong> contribute to climate change.
                By examining these emissions, we highlight the urgent need for sustainable solutions to 
                address the growing challenge of global warming.

            This interactive map shows the <strong>global distribution</strong> of CO2 emissions from 1960 to 2021, 
            measured in Million Metric Tons (Mt). Industrialized nations like China, the USA, and Russia are the 
            <strong>largest contributors</strong>, while emissions remain lower across much of Africa and South America.
            <br>
            As time progresses, the map highlights <strong>rising emissions</strong>, especially in rapidly developing economies 
            such as China. The color scale visualizes these changes, with the colour scale (viridis) moving towards yellow, indicating higher CO2 outputs, 
            reflecting the increasing <strong>environmental impact</strong> of <strong>industrial activities</strong> worldwide.

        <h2>Major Contributors to CO2 Emissions</h2>
        <div id="stacked_bar_chart"></div>
        <p id="sec2_text" class="text">
            This stacked bar chart shows <strong>global CO2 emissions</strong> by the source of CO2 emissions from 2000 to 2021, 
            broken down into major contributors such as <strong>coal, oil, gas, cement</strong>, and others. 
            Each bar represents the total emissions for a given year, with segments showing each source’s contribution.
            <br>
            The chart highlights the <strong>dominance of fossil fuels</strong>, especially <strong>coal and gas</strong>, 
            in driving emissions. While overall emissions have steadily increased, there are signs of <strong>shifts toward 
            cleaner energy</strong> in recent years. Users can interact with the chart to explore specific sources 
            and time periods, offering valuable insights into how <strong>industrial activities</strong> 
            and energy consumption impact the environment.This visualization helps analysts, policymakers, 
            and industries track <strong>key emission trends</strong> 
            and work toward more <strong>sustainable solutions</strong>.

        <h2>Coal Emissions by Country (1960-2021)</h2>
        <div id="line_chart"></div>
        <p id="sec3_text" class="text">
            This line chart illustrates <strong>coal-related CO2 emissions</strong> from 1960 to 2021 across six major coal 
            producers: <span style="color:green;"><strong>Australia</strong></span>, China, India, Russia, South Africa, and 
            Indonesia. The chart highlights coal’s role as a key energy source, focusing on <span style="color:green;">
            <strong>Australia’s contribution</strong></span> to global emissions.
            <br>
            While <span style="color:green;"><strong>Australia</strong></span> is known for its 
            vast <strong>coal reserves</strong> and reliance on coal-fired power plants, its emissions are still far 
            below those of China, which has seen a rapid increase in coal consumption since the early 2000s. 
            <strong>China’s exponential rise</strong> now makes it the dominant source of global coal emissions, 
            overshadowing other countries.
            <br>
            This chart allows for <strong>comparisons</strong> between <span style="color:green;">
            <strong>Australia</strong></span> and other nations. India shows steady growth, while Russia’s 
            emissions remain relatively stable. Despite <span style="color:green;"><strong>Australia</strong></span> 
            being a top coal exporter, recent years show slight efforts toward a transition to 
            <strong>cleaner energy sources</strong>.
            This visualization highlights <span style="color:green;"><strong>Australia’s</strong></span> 
            role in global coal emissions and underscores the need for strategies to balance 
            <strong>economic growth</strong> with <strong>environmental responsibility</strong>.

        <div id="bubble_chart"></div>
        <p id="sec4_text" class="text">
            This bubble chart shows the relationship between <strong>CO2 emissions per capita</strong> and 
            <strong>total emissions</strong> for various countries in 2021. Each bubble's size represents total emissions, 
            with <span style="color:green;"><strong>Australia</strong></span> highlighted in green. This chart compares 
            both per capita emissions and the total emissions.
            <span style="color:green;"><strong>Australia’s</strong></span> CO2 emissions per capita are over 15 metric tons, 
            making it one of the top emitters per person, though its total emissions are much lower than global leaders like 
            <strong>China</strong>, the <strong>USA</strong>, and <strong>India</strong>. China leads with over 11,000 Mt, 
            while <span style="color:green;"><strong>Australia</strong></span> is around 391 Mt.

            This heatmap highlights  <strong>per capita CO2 emissions</strong> of the top four emitters
            — <strong>Qatar</strong>, <strong>Kuwait</strong>, <strong>Bahrain</strong>, and <strong>Brunei</strong>
            — compared to <span style="color:green;"><strong>Australia</strong></span> and the <strong>USA</strong> 
            from 2010 to 2021.Unlike the previous bubble chart, which compared total vs. per capita emissions, 
            this heatmap focuses solely on per capita emissions. <strong>Qatar</strong> leads with the highest per 
            capita emissions, followed by <strong>Kuwait</strong> and <strong>Bahrain</strong>.
            Despite its lower total emissions, <span style="color:green;"><strong>Australia</strong></span> 
            still ranks high in per capita emissions, surpassing the USA. This visualization highlights the impact of smaller, 
            energy-intensive countries and <span style="color:green;"><strong>Australia’s</strong></span> ongoing challenge in 
            managing its carbon footprint.
